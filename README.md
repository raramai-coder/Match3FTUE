# Match3FTUE

Welcome to the Match3 First-Time-User-Experience repository! This project focuses on developing a user-friendly onboarding experience for a Match-3 puzzle game, emphasizing First-Time User Experience (FTUE) design principles.
Most players would be aware of the rules of a match-3 game however this game allows users to move tiles which do not lead to a match, allowing for users to plan ahead and do moves they usually would not be able to.
The goal of this project is to teach players how to play with these new rules without using text, but rather making the rules and play as intuitive as possible.
